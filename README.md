How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Maintainable code looks like it would be the easiest to write. If you want to add features and keep your software up-to-date, you'll need to make it modular and reusable. This allows improvements to be made to an existing application without necessitating frequent code rewrites. To ensure your code is readable, you should organize it in a logical fashion and include detailed comments. In this sense, adaptability is synonymous with durability. Modular code, in which each function is designed to do a single task, makes it easier to change the input and output data types of a function to suit the current requirements.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
In my capacity as a computer scientist, I would first consider the problem's ultimate purpose before selecting the appropriate methods. If I were to create anything, it would be the simplest of tools and the code to use them. This was unlike any other class I've taken. To begin using a database for the first time. It was an interesting strategy to construct a database, CRUD module, and interactive website. Previously, I used arrays, vectors, and objects to store information. Even more so when there's a lot of facts to consider, that's not easy. That's not everything that was accomplished with this endeavor. I plan on using these tactics, especially CRUD. I'm trying to figure out how to import this into a SQL database I'm developing for my website. If I need to sort through a large amount of information rapidly, aggregation will come in handy.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In other words, computer scientists are problem-solvers. They create programs that are faster at processing data and more accurate in their computations than any person could be on their own. The products they create make people's and organizations' lives easier and more successful. This is significant since computers have fundamentally altered several industries. Fancy animated entertainment (like 3D graphics films) and video games would not exist without computers and computer scientists, while basic tasks like tallying the number of workers at different enterprises across states would take hours instead of seconds. Work on such a project might aid businesses in quickly and cheaply locating what they want. The organization needed dogs of a certain breed and age range to do certain tasks. Given there are over 10,000 canine records, doing the research by hand would take hours. This project will make that function efficient, scalable, and quick. It would continue to function even if another 10,000 dogs were added. This means the effort is only expended once, rather than repeatedly when fresh data is accumulated.
